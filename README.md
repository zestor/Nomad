# Nomad

Nomad is a Windows desktop application that allows the user to quickly manage their career search for Avanade job postings. For the professional seeking a career at Avanade it's a great tool for finding new job postings and watching for job postings as they are filled. 
This project is neither sponsored or endorsed by Avanade.

The program downloads the latest 1,000 job postings from Avanade.com in JSON format into a file automatically formatted for today's date and time stamp.

Downloading additional files on the same day will delete any previous files for that day.

Historically the user can view how the job postings are changing based on the last file downloaded.

The application also allows the user to mark job postings they are not interested in or apply for those they are interested in.
